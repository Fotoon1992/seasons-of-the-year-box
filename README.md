SEASONS OF THE YEAR
2019

This project was built as an educational game for kids to learn about seasons. It teaches them the difference between each season an another, it also helps memorizing all actions and objects that are related to each season of the year. It gives the parents as well the opportunity to engage with their children and teach them what we wear? where we see? what we eat? for each season.
